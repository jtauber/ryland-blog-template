# ryland-blog-template
a template for a blog built using Ryland

Install `requirements.txt` in a virtualenv and run `./build.py`.

The workflow in `.github` will also build on push.

You **will definitely** need to change:
 - `pages`
 - `posts`
 - `site_data.yaml`
 - `templates/_sidebar.html` (until I factor out the content)

You **will probably** need to change:
 - `pantry/styles.css`

You **may** need to change:
 - some of the `templates/`

You **probably don't** need to change:
 - `build.py` (although let me know if you do!)
